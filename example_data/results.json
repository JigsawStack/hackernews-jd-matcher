Eight years ago, I co-founded an AI Math Tutoring company (amy.app). My role was CTO, and we scaled the company to about 25 employees. It was a fully remote company, and we were distributed across all parts of the world.\nBefore that, I completed my PhD in HRI (Human-Robot Interaction) at the University of Oxford, in conjunction with the University of Canterbury, where I focused on the persuasive power of voice agents. My favorite working environments are early-stage startups with high growth potential.\nRecently, with the release of the OpenAI real-time API, my interest in VUI (Voice User Interface) was reignited. I really love the VUI paradigm and strongly believe it will be the next big change in the way we communicate with computers.\nHere is a project I built during the winter holiday: https://www.callgeist.com. I used almost exclusively Cursor for the UI. The backend uses Twilio + OpenAI real-time.\nHere are a couple of other things I did last year:\n - https://www.line-items.com is a simple receipt-to-JSON parser. This was written in just one day, but it landed on the front page of HN. - https://distill.fyi is LinkedIn on steroids, auto-generating user profiles given a LinkedIn URL. My task was to build a QA system that detects if generated profiles would regress because of prompt changes. I used my know-how from amy.app, where we had a similar problem of undetected \"approved\" content regression due to prompt changes. - https://www.spaarkd.com is a company that allows you to prompt a garment, which is then produced and delivered to your doorstep. My job was to set up the entire infrastructure, orchestration (payment, shipping, production line), and team.",

I'm looking to join a team where I can contribute significantly to a product and solve interesting problems. I am always eager to learn new skills, grow, and tackle new challenges.\nI just finished three years of work at a learning startup called Pivot Interactives, which Discovery Education acquired. While working for Pivot Interactives, I was a full-stack web developer on a team of four developers implementing features from the design phase to deployment. I created easy-to-use and accessible tools for teachers and students to supplement high-school-level science labs by serving students with thousands of videos and assignments daily. This included integrations with learning platforms, custom WYSIWYG editor components, auto-grading, and student testing systems.\nBefore Pivot Interactives, I was a senior software development engineer at Corning Inc., creating hardware/software that quality-controlled billions of consumer electronic devices. I also wrote tools for scientists to interface with custom-made hardware and commercially available equipment. (DAQs, Motor Controllers, Liquid Crystal polarizers, industrial automation systems, etc.)\nFeel free to reach out if you have any questions!",

I was previously an adjunct lecturer in the computer science department at Hunter College. I taught the capstone project course, where I supervised student groups on their final projects for the degree. This was an interesting experience because I effectively got to oversee an estimated 3-4K combined human hours of coding per semester.\nI spend a majority of my free time programming to learn and keep rounding out my computer science knowledge -- I think coding something up is a great way to truly understand the topic. Currently I am fascinated with databases, and I am writing an RDBMS from scratch in OCaml. I have implemented low level file management operations, buffer pool and transaction management, pipelined query processing, a disk backed B+ tree, and a simple parser/interpreter that ties in with the query processing engine. This project is released as a pedagogical tool for others who want to do database hacking in OCaml.\nI am currently writing up a series of posts on how I designed the disk backed B+ tree and implemented it: https://artjomplaunov.github.io/database/b+/tree/2025/01/13/...\nI am open to any work that involves programming; although I use OCaml in my own projects, I am comfortable with any systems programming languages such as C/C++ and Go, and I am quick to pick up new languages and frameworks.",

I've been fully remote since 2016 and have hired and managed globally remote team members at multiple companies.\nWhile I've spent the majority of my career in venture-funded b2b SaaS, I'm highly-interested in working with bootstrapped companies who are hiring AI engineers to solve important problems. Bonus points if the use-case for AI is connected with the physical world in some way. I'm one of the folks who expect that artificial intelligence will continue to revolutionize our industry in many unexpected ways and I'm highly interested in working with a team of AI engineers who are breaking ground in the space.\nOver the holidays I built a Rails application (I hadn't built with Rails in a while) that analyzes satellite imagery along US coastlines to visually identify potential boat anchorages using space imagery. It works by taking in geographic coordinates (geojson), fetching satellite images from Google Maps for the corresponding points, and using a fine-tuned machine learning model to classify areas that are likely suitable anchorages. I added a built-in interface for training (SFT) the ML with new data.\nOn the dev side, I generally prefer buying over building, readable over concise, fast over perfect, and empathy over all.\nOn the management side, my approach centers on 1:1s, transparent retros, and fostering a deep understanding of the business purpose behind the work we do.

My leadership style centers on measurable results that align with both customer and company needs, blending strategic vision with technical expertise.\nAccomplishments and Expertise:\n* Team Building and Leadership: Scaled teams from zero to 12 direct reports and later managed a 40+ person product and engineering organization, splitting the group into three specialized teams to align with business needs. Successfully hired and mentored managers to lead these teams, developed overseas and remote teams, and maintained strong engagement and efficiency in distributed environments.\n* Multi-Cloud Strategy: Designed and implemented multi-cloud strategies across AWS, GCP, and Azure to ensure scalability, cost optimization, and system reliability. Balanced vendor lock-in risks with business needs, enabling high availability and flexibility.\n* Scaling and Developing Teams: Successfully scaled engineering teams to meet rapid growth demands by leveraging internal hires, external agencies, and outsourcing partners. Built a sustainable and adaptable structure by hiring and developing technical leaders, including Engineering Managers, Architects, and Principal Engineers.\n* Operational and Process Optimization: Adapted team workflows to align with evolving business priorities—transitioning from high-skilled Kanban teams for greenfield projects to balanced SCRUM teams for routine work. This flexibility ensured efficiency while meeting strategic objectives.\nHigh-Performance Systems: Led efforts to support 15B requests per week while maintaining a 99.999% SLA and 100% uptime. Developed automation for incident resolution, debugging, and diagnostics, improving time-to-detect and time-to-resolve while reducing on-call burden for engineers.\n* Cost Savings and Innovation: Implemented systems inspired by dampening physics to save $10M+ per year in budget overages. Led a project that re-architected an edge network to resolve latency issues while creating the foundation for new revenue streams. Delivered results consistently ahead of schedule, including MVP launches and new network architectures.\n* Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI): Built and led diverse teams, including underrepresented groups, and volunteered for ERGs supporting DEI initiatives. Mentored for HackBright Academy to help increase the representation of women in tech.\n* Customer and Stakeholder Focus: Managed multi-million-dollar incident responses, leading efforts from live management to customer communications and root-cause analysis. Balanced technical leadership and customer advocacy to ensure timely resolutions and foster trust.",

Technologies: The DS & DE stack (Python, SQL) + Airflow, Cloud Résumé/CV: https://carloseduardo.omg.lol/ Email: carlose.cortesg at gmail.com Github: https://github.com/carlose-cortesg\nI'm Carlos, a Data and Analytics specialist with 8+ years of experience, looking for an exciting startup to join. I have a strong foundation in statistics and hands-on experience in:\n- Cloud deployments (AWS, GCP, Azure): I can build and manage complex data systems in the cloud.\n- Data modelling: Designing efficient and scalable data structures is my bread and butter.\n- Research and analysis: I can turn data into actionable insights.\n- ML + AI + DS implementation: I can integrate models into data or product workflows.\n- Code optimization: I really like the challenge of making some code, some pipeline or some query to make cheaper or faster.\nMy background is primarily in financial applications, but I'm open to exploring other industries. I thrive in smaller, fast-paced environments where I can wear many hats and contribute to the team's success. I'm a team player and not afraid to roll up my sleeves and get things done.",
