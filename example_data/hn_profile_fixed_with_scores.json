Eight years ago, I co-founded an AI Math Tutoring company (amy.app). My role was CTO, and we scaled the company to about 25 employees. It was a fully remote company, and we were distributed across all parts of the world.\nBefore that, I completed my PhD in HRI (Human-Robot Interaction) at the University of Oxford, in conjunction with the University of Canterbury, where I focused on the persuasive power of voice agents. My favorite working environments are early-stage startups with high growth potential.\nRecently, with the release of the OpenAI real-time API, my interest in VUI (Voice User Interface) was reignited. I really love the VUI paradigm and strongly believe it will be the next big change in the way we communicate with computers.\nHere is a project I built during the winter holiday: https://www.callgeist.com. I used almost exclusively Cursor for the UI. The backend uses Twilio + OpenAI real-time.\nHere are a couple of other things I did last year:\n - https://www.line-items.com is a simple receipt-to-JSON parser. This was written in just one day, but it landed on the front page of HN. - https://distill.fyi is LinkedIn on steroids, auto-generating user profiles given a LinkedIn URL. My task was to build a QA system that detects if generated profiles would regress because of prompt changes. I used my know-how from amy.app, where we had a similar problem of undetected \"approved\" content regression due to prompt changes. - https://www.spaarkd.com is a company that allows you to prompt a garment, which is then produced and delivered to your doorstep. My job was to set up the entire infrastructure, orchestration (payment, shipping, production line), and team.",

I took the last two years off employment to work on coding side projects and to polish my habits and health. During this time, my technical achievements were: I taught myself Rust & Bevy and played around with building a game, taught myself some basic EE skills and prototyped hardware using an Arduino, taught myself Svelte/Sveltekit and built an especially popular website for an upcoming game which I am still maintaining. Physically, I quit drinking coffee and alcohol and smoking weed, started running 20+ miles a week and ran my first half-marathon for fun, and put on a good amount of muscle mass with a solid lifting routine and a clean diet. I feel great about these decisions and am firing on all cylinders.\nThis is my first day of looking for a new, interesting project to work on as part of a team. I'm not especially firm on what I'm looking for - just an interesting project at a company with smart people and a good trajectory. It would be a cool growth opportunity to be a leader of leaders, but equally reasonable to start more hands-on assuming there's room for growth. My ideal would be to find myself working for a bootstrapped, profitable company of 50-100 people under a technical founder, writing in TypeScript while leading a team of 4-6, and growing into leading multiple teams after gaining an understanding of the business and influence with my peers.\nThanks for your time!",

My most involved project was working across the stack on a hole-in-one application for the weather service that consolidates a bunch of old applications. I am flexible and love learning new technology & procedures. My previous work comrades always described me as high-spirited, excited, and always amped to take on new tasks (although I must be honest - moving those 10,000+ vanilla JS files was a bit cumbersome).\nAll in all, I am very excited to jump into something new. I am actively looking for full-time or contract work.

I worked in life sciences for many years, until in 2023 I joined a healthcare startup, which for an exciting year and a half was a great opportunity to experiment with 'modern practice' like Databricks and integrating LLMs. Looking for new opportunities to engage in meaningful work.\nFrom my bioinformatics and data engineer experience, I'm good at interfacing with researchers and turning ideas and prototypes into working products: developing data flow workflows, evaluating performance of models, providing interfaces and entry points for clients, and more.\nThroughout my career, I've had the privilege of contributing to significant projects in academic, commercial, and non-profit settings.

I was previously an adjunct lecturer in the computer science department at Hunter College. I taught the capstone project course, where I supervised student groups on their final projects for the degree. This was an interesting experience because I effectively got to oversee an estimated 3-4K combined human hours of coding per semester.\nI spend a majority of my free time programming to learn and keep rounding out my computer science knowledge -- I think coding something up is a great way to truly understand the topic. Currently I am fascinated with databases, and I am writing an RDBMS from scratch in OCaml. I have implemented low level file management operations, buffer pool and transaction management, pipelined query processing, a disk backed B+ tree, and a simple parser/interpreter that ties in with the query processing engine. This project is released as a pedagogical tool for others who want to do database hacking in OCaml.\nI am currently writing up a series of posts on how I designed the disk backed B+ tree and implemented it: https://artjomplaunov.github.io/database/b+/tree/2025/01/13/...\nI am open to any work that involves programming; although I use OCaml in my own projects, I am comfortable with any systems programming languages such as C/C++ and Go, and I am quick to pick up new languages and frameworks.",

I've been fully remote since 2016 and have hired and managed globally remote team members at multiple companies.\nWhile I've spent the majority of my career in venture-funded b2b SaaS, I'm highly-interested in working with bootstrapped companies who are hiring AI engineers to solve important problems. Bonus points if the use-case for AI is connected with the physical world in some way. I'm one of the folks who expect that artificial intelligence will continue to revolutionize our industry in many unexpected ways and I'm highly interested in working with a team of AI engineers who are breaking ground in the space.\nOver the holidays I built a Rails application (I hadn't built with Rails in a while) that analyzes satellite imagery along US coastlines to visually identify potential boat anchorages using space imagery. It works by taking in geographic coordinates (geojson), fetching satellite images from Google Maps for the corresponding points, and using a fine-tuned machine learning model to classify areas that are likely suitable anchorages. I added a built-in interface for training (SFT) the ML with new data.\nOn the dev side, I generally prefer buying over building, readable over concise, fast over perfect, and empathy over all.\nOn the management side, my approach centers on 1:1s, transparent retros, and fostering a deep understanding of the business purpose behind the work we do. If this sounds like the type of culture that you have or wish to build, I'd love to hear from you and learn how I can support your mission and the team helping you accomplish it.",

My leadership style centers on measurable results that align with both customer and company needs, blending strategic vision with technical expertise.\nAccomplishments and Expertise:\n* Team Building and Leadership: Scaled teams from zero to 12 direct reports and later managed a 40+ person product and engineering organization, splitting the group into three specialized teams to align with business needs. Successfully hired and mentored managers to lead these teams, developed overseas and remote teams, and maintained strong engagement and efficiency in distributed environments.\n* Multi-Cloud Strategy: Designed and implemented multi-cloud strategies across AWS, GCP, and Azure to ensure scalability, cost optimization, and system reliability. Balanced vendor lock-in risks with business needs, enabling high availability and flexibility.\n* Scaling and Developing Teams: Successfully scaled engineering teams to meet rapid growth demands by leveraging internal hires, external agencies, and outsourcing partners. Built a sustainable and adaptable structure by hiring and developing technical leaders, including Engineering Managers, Architects, and Principal Engineers.\n* Operational and Process Optimization: Adapted team workflows to align with evolving business priorities—transitioning from high-skilled Kanban teams for greenfield projects to balanced SCRUM teams for routine work. This flexibility ensured efficiency while meeting strategic objectives.\nHigh-Performance Systems: Led efforts to support 15B requests per week while maintaining a 99.999% SLA and 100% uptime. Developed automation for incident resolution, debugging, and diagnostics, improving time-to-detect and time-to-resolve while reducing on-call burden for engineers.\n* Cost Savings and Innovation: Implemented systems inspired by dampening physics to save $10M+ per year in budget overages. Led a project that re-architected an edge network to resolve latency issues while creating the foundation for new revenue streams. Delivered results consistently ahead of schedule, including MVP launches and new network architectures.\n* Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI): Built and led diverse teams, including underrepresented groups, and volunteered for ERGs supporting DEI initiatives. Mentored for HackBright Academy to help increase the representation of women in tech.\n* Customer and Stakeholder Focus: Managed multi-million-dollar incident responses, leading efforts from live management to customer communications and root-cause analysis.
